        <h2> Our Goal </h2>
          <p>   By now, I am sure everyone has come across a website, post, flyer, whatever it may be, telling you how to take precautions that help prevent individuals contracting COVID-19 or spreading it to others. One of the best ways is through social distancing, but there are a lot of added consequences (or benefits) that come along with this. We hope this page to be a place that have compiled a list of resources on tips ranging from staying busy during quarantine, keeping your mental healthy happy, maintaining relationships, and of course, stopping the spread. </p>
          <center><p> In the future, we see this website as a place for users to share their experiences, ideas, and activities that have been done during this time as a way for others to learn, or simply just for a fun read! </p></center>

      <h2> Stopping the Spread </h2>
        <center><p> When it comes to doing your part to make sure cases stay low as possible, there are numerous different ways to participate! Below are just a few steps to take, but for a more detailed description of each step, check out the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html" >official CDC website</a>.</center>

        <center><p> It is important to take every precaution when going outside during this pandemic, especially with cases rising. This also means staying home unless you are going outside for something completely necessary, such as groceries or because you are an essential worker. Below are resources that will educate and help you continue to social distance safely. </p></center>

Before dropping of the masks, be sure to call and set up a time that works for them. They are fighting on the frontlines, and the least we can do to thank them is provide them with some extra protection. **

        <h2> Staying Home </h2>
        <center><p> While staying home can seem like a bore, with the right mindset, it is possible to make quarantine a productive time in your life, from exploring new Hobbis to participating in programs such as Kode with Klossy! Here are a few ways to make this massive amount of free time into something a little more useful. (But don't overwork yourself. Reward yourself with breaks, you deserve it.) </p> </center>
        
        
        <div class="homeList">
        <p> 1. Google <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2020/03/16/coronavirus-quarantine-100-things-do-while-trapped-inside/5054632002/">generic lists</a> of activities to do during quarantine, or something a 
          little more catered to your own taste. <p>
        <p> 2. Use the Hobbi website to discover new hobbies and look into upcoming local events. </p>
        <p> 3. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2020/03/16/coronavirus-quarantine-100-things-do-while-trapped-inside/5054632002/"> Volunteer from home </a> by connecting with organizations such as the UN, Crisis Hotlines and more! </p>
        <p> 4. Use <a href="https://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/2012/10/07/30-great-places-to-learn-a-new-instrument-online/"> these </a> websites to learn a new instrument, or sharpen skills on one you already know how to play!</p>
        <p> 5. Look into ways to make $$$ during quarantine. If you're a high school or college student, perhaps a tutoring job may be right up your alley. If you are qualified in a certain subject, look into ways online to make those skills useful in a time of isolation. If you're of age and feel comfortable to do so, get a job at the local market, though this is not reccomended due to the higher risk of contracting COVID-19. <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/12-ideas-to-help-you-make-money-during-the-coronavirus"> Here </a>are a list of just a few ways to make that bank! More will soon be added to this website as we expand.
